## Detailed Description

Admin access security is necessary for every site. And when it comes to ecommerce sites like PrestaShop, it is mandatory to keep the admin login and password secured. 

But sometimes you need to share access of your PrestaShop site right? Then go through the hassle of changing it again?

Temporary Login Access for PrestaShop makes it easier for you to share site login access more securely. You wont need to change the password back because Temporary Login Access does it automatically for you.

1. Create an employee account
2. Set and expiration date

That's all.

Now stop worrying and share the access to anyone you want. After the access is expired the password of that employee of your prestashop site will be regenerated. 

So it is secured.

Don't waste time and energy on changing your PrestaShop site employee login access again again. It will be done automatically.
